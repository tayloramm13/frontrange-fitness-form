The purpose of this assignment is to be a base for future forms. This will be the first form that I have ever made and the goal is to properly utilize all elements of a form + basic CSS styling.

1. Select a design to act as large background-image
2. Pick external font for 'logo' section.
3. For the image-sidebar, use Odin logo.

Beginning assignment:
