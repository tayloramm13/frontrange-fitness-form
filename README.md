The purpose of this assignment is to be a base for future forms. This will be the first form that I have ever made and the goal is to properly utilize all elements of a form + basic CSS styling.

1. Select a design to act as large background-image
2. Pick external font for 'logo' section.
3. For the image-sidebar, use Odin logo.

Beginning assignment:
PRO-TIP ~ Draw out the desired structure of the page and tackle sections one by one!


Tips:
- Area behind business name is a <div> with a dark, but semi-transparent background color (CSS: opacity)
- Color of submit button has tones from background image
- Give all inputs some sort of neutral color border
    - When contact information validly completed give green border
